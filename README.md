# Ariston NET remotethermo integration for Home Assistant
This integration based on chomupashchuk fantastic work https://github.com/chomupashchuk/ariston-remotethermo-home-assistant-v2
But it does not use Ariston website. It uses Ariston API what I reversed engineered. Lot of things are still missing. Use v2 if you need more.

## Integration was tested on and works with:
- Ariston Alteas One 24

I only have one Ariston Alteas One with only one zone, but feel free to test something else and create new issue / pull request if something goes wrong.

## Installation
Copy ariston folder to your configuration/custom_components path or use hacs custom repositories.
Use the add integration UI to set up your device.
